    "A connected pore-throat-pore element in the PNM is defined as a conduit and the estimation of conduitâ€™s conductance for mass transports has been an active research area since the PNM technique was developed. Common shape factor approach in estimating diffusive conductance can be erroneous for real void space with highly complex geometrical shapes. An alternative to analytical methods based on shape factor is to use DNS to estimate the flow/diffusive conductance of pore network elements. Although this approach increases the PNM accuracy, it is computationally expensive to conduct this analysis on every tomogram that the pore network is extracted. This example demonstrates how PoreSpy tackles this problem to estimate diffusive size factors of conduits using a deep learning framework."
